![mern-blog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85912934/197315791-e4cc3d8e-b60d-4f5d-a066-b55983da0196.png)

The backend was built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Prettier to make the code easier to read, Eslint (Airbnb and 
Prettier configurations) to find problems in the code, nodemon to restart the app when a server change is made, concurrently to run both the client and server simultaneously, 
bcryptjs to encrypt and decrypt the users' password, colors to make certain console logs pop out, 
cors tells the browser that the app at its origin (e.g. localhost:5000) has access to resources at another origin (e.g. localhost:3000), 
dotenv to keep certain information secret, express-async-handler to handle async express route exceptions, 
jsonwebtoken to give each user a unique token, and multer to upload files.

The frontend utilizes Material-UI with Emotion for styling, axios for HTTP requests, react-redux, redux-persist, and reduxjs/toolkit to manage the logged in user's state, and react-router-dom to handle the app's web routing.
